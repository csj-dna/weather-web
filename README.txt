I was initially going for a simple weather web app, but then we added more features and focused on the UI to make it better

I tried to make a simple responsive travel website that has weather forecast by using openweather API.
 + Type in the city name you want to check weather at the moment 
 + A validation for login form and signup which will return an Object (your info) if you type in correctly 
 + UI: we used Bootstrap and other library to achieve the design.
